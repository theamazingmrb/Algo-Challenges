## Instructions 
Set a timer and give yourself 1 hour to solve each problem. After the hour stop coding, stop and take 15 minutes to write down your approach, why you took that approach, and the big O notation of your alorithm.

After you finish the 1 hours and 15 minute assessments for your two challenges, you are free to return and work more on your algorithm or try the next.


### How to approach coding when your mind goes completely blank:

1. Don't panic; going blank happens to everybody from time to time. 

2. If you do panic, start reminding yourself you can get through this

3. Take a moment away from the task to stable your mind.

4. Drawing things out and Pseudocode everything

5. Break down the code into smaller pieces
